# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: 
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineerings principles, methods and tools to  the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. 

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?  
software engineering encompassses the entire software development while tradtional programming focuses on a smaller part on writing code for implementation on specific functions within software development.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Various phases of Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC) are;
1. Requirements: gathering and documenting user needs and system requirement.
2. Design: creating high level and detailed design of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation: writing code and building the software acording to the designspecifications.
Testing: conducting software tests to ensure quality standard and functional requirement.
4. Deployment: releasing softwares to customers or users.
5. Maintenance: providing supports, updates and enhancement to softwares after deployment.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
  agile models
  approach: incremental and iterative
  sprints: work divided into time based sprints
  Flexibility: prioritizes rapid iteration
Waterfalls models;
Aproach: linear and sequential
phases: well defined stages
reuirement; All requirement fo each steps are completed before moving to the next.
key differences; agile emphasizes flexibility, customer feedback and interative progress while waterfalls follows top-down approach.
waterfalls models are preffered for large complex project with specified reuirement while Agile models are required for project with resource allocated as per the stakeholders needs and reuirement.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
requirement engineering is a systematic process used to define, document and maintain engineering project.
processes;
feasibilty study;examining technical, economic, legal and schedule feasibility.
requirement analysis; gather detailed requirement to ensure systems align well with users needs.
software requirement specification: document requirements in a standard format.
Validation; verify that the requirements accurately reflect the desired system.
importance;
client satisfaction;meet client expectation
cost efficiency
traceability- consistent tracing and change management.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
refers to design approach that emphasizes diving complex software system into smaller modules with specific functions through well defined interfaces.
maintainability-when one module is updated, it doesnot affect entire system.
scalability- new features can be added without disrupting the whole system.
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
unit testing- to check if individual sofware component fulfil its functionalities.
integration Testing- to verify data flow between different moodules.
system testing-test entire system as a whole
acceptance testing-to check the software if it fulfils user requirement before delivery.
testing is crucial in software development as it helps in detecting defects, improve software quality, ensures compatibility and enhances users experience.
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
version control system- software tools that track changes to files overtime.

why important;
help maintain different software versions aligning with release roadsmap.
prevent code conflicts within source base.
tracks changes to other digital artifacts like design.
popular versions;
git- speed and flexibility
Subversion- tracking capabilities.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Project Manager plays role in overseeing the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.
responsibilities;
project planning, team management, communication, risk managemnet and quality assurance.
Challenges;
Technical challenges-adressing technical complexities.
scope creep-changes in project requirement that leads to delays and increased cost.
resource constraints-balancing limited resources
dealing with conflicting interests and priorities.
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance refers to ongoing process and update of software to ensure continued effectiveness and relevance through its lifecycle.
types of software maintenance
corrective maintenance-fixing defects to restore functionality
Adaptive maintenance- making changes to the software to adapt its changes to environment.
preventive Maintenance-aims to prevent future issues like security updates.
why maintenance is essential;
sustainability to ensure long term lifecycle by addressing issues and update to technologies.
user satisfaction by fixing defects and enhancing features.
Sercurity-protect against potential threats and cyber attacks.
maintenance activities may also ensure software remains compliant with relevant regulations, standards and best preactices.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
1. privacy concerns-handling user data in a way that respects privacy rights and protect sensitive information from unauthorizd access.
2.security- ensuring software systems are resilient to cyber threats.
3. bias and fairness-ensure systems that are free from bias and discrimination.
4. intellectual property-avoiding copyright infringementor plagiarism.
5. Social responsibility-consider potential social and environmental impacts of sofware projects.
how software engineers adhere to ethical standards;
educating themselves by staying informed about ethical principles and code of conduct.
follow ethical guidelines like Association for Computing Machinery
advocate for ethical practices.

Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
